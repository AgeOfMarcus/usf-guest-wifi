Script to register on the USF Guest WiFi from the command line.

Tested at University of South Florida, Tampa campus.

## The last request doesn't work. Please submit a PR if you know what's wrong.
I'm still trying to figure it out.

# Usage

`python usf-guest-registration.py -h`

Either run in interactive mode for normal use, or use modes register and validate for scripting use.

# Future ideas

1. make it work
2. make it import-able
